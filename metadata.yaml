description: 'A summary of the tests performed in the Spring of 2019 to quantify the impact of variable seeing on the quality of the Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) correction algorithm. The current state of the DCR algorithm naively assumes that all of the input exposures used to construct the template have identical PSFs, and there has been some concern that the quality of the model will degrade when those input exposures have variable seeing. In this note I compare the performance of templates created with DcrAssembleCoaddTask with our current standard, CompareWarpAssembleCoaddTask, and estimate the range of observing conditions where the current algorithm is sufficient.'
